# Election-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a script that will read the voting information from a file and format the results. For this project we used three counties and determined the voter turnout by county. With those results we printed the largest county turnout, as well as the votes per candidate and the candidate winner. 

## Results 
### How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
>There were a total of 369,711 votes 

### Which county had the largest number of votes?
>Denver county had the largest number of votes

### Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
>Diana Degette won the election with 272,892 votes at 73.8%

## Election Summary

In summary, this can be a great tool for simple readings of voter turnouts. It can be used in any election, the script will just need to be modified to read a new data file.
